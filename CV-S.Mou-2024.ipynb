    "### PROJECTS\n",
    "- 10/2023-01/2024:   **3D Computer Graphics assignments**\n",
    "    - **Snake game**: Developed a simple snake game using three.js, implementing a 10x10 grid-based playing field with a growing snake, red ball collisions, and interactive controls. Integrated three.js audio interface for sound effects upon ball consumption and game over events\n",
    "    - **3D Clock**: Designed and implemented a 3-dimensional clock using three.js, featuring a cylindrical main body with mouse-controlled rotation. Integrated small and large ticks to denote minutes and five-minute intervals, respectively, with a marked twelve o'clock position. Developed dual-sided clocks displaying both local time (Hamburg) and the time of a preferred location outside the current time zone\n",
    "    - **Billiard Table Simulation**: Developed a realistic billiard simulation using three.js, featuring a proportionally accurate table with cushions, legs, and ground placement. Implemented eight billiard balls with textures, each assigned a random velocity vector. And enabled elastic collisions, reducing the speed of a ball by 30% upon collision. Apply realistic shadows and enhanced the scene with a ceiling, a spot light above the table represented by a yellow light bulb.\n",
    "- 06/2023-11/2023:   **Elective project: Development of a ROS -based module for the detection and relative localization of construction site beacons**\n",
    "    - implementation of an object classifier YOLOv4 for construction site beacons based on a Ladybug-camera from the test vehicle as an inline module based on ROS Noetic as part of EDDY (European Digital Dynamic Mapping) project with the main following steps:\n",
    "        - *Data collection*: annotating collected dataset of images containing construction site beacons with bonding boxes around beacons\n",
    "        - *Data processing*: split the dataset into 3 sets: test, train, valid\n",
    "        - *Model training*: train the YOLOv4 model using Google Colab then evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the valid dataset, to use the weights with OpenCV\n",
    "        - *ROS integration*: developing a ROS node that takes images from a camera as input then integrate the trained model within this node and ROS messages and topics to handle input data (images) and output data (beacon detection, relative localization)\n",
    "        - *Relative Localization*: applying some algorithms to calculate the distance and the angle of the beacons in respect to the camera on the test vehicle and use the results to calculate the relative localization of the detected beacons\n",
    "        - *Publishing the results*: publish the detected beacon position and relative locations as ROS messages to a topic\n",
